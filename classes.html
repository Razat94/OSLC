			Gifted education is reserved for students who can work at a faster pace as we try to challenge their critical thinking skills through extended education classes. Gifted students are required to complete all school homework and projects in a timely manner in order to allow time for their enrichment schedule workload. For certain students who excel in this program, we offer additional services under the title "Highly Gifted," which includes an invitation to participate in private tutoring sessions to help with scholastic testing such as ISEE, HSPT, and GATE.
